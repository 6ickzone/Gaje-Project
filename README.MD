# Gaje Project

**Author:** 0x6ick  
**Tagline:** Random tools, ongoing. 

## Description
This project was born from our curiosity and boredom to experiment with various things.  
Some are single-file utilities, some may grow into bigger projects.  
Expect randomness and creativity here — tools come and go.

## Current Tools
- **BengkelSempak** — single-file PHP tool for domain grabbing, extension generator, and mass checking. (Check its folder for README & details)  
- More tools will be added as I develop them.

## Tips
- Tools are mostly for learning, testing, or internal use.  
- Always check each tool's own README for usage and details.

## License
Most tools use WTFPL — do whatever you want, responsibly.

## Note
Stay tuned for more gaje tools.
